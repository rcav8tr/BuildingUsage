Display how much a building is being used as a percent of its capacity.

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
The building usage is integrated into the Levels info view.
Therefore, this mod is normally not available until the Levels info view becomes available in the game at milestone Tiny Town.
The Levels info view is available earlier if you use another mod to unlock milestones
(e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=458519223]Unlock All + Wonders & Landmarks[/url]
by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bloody_penguin/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710]BloodyPenguin[/url]).

The Levels info view now has five tabs:
[b]Levels[/b] - displays the normal Levels info view, which is unchanged by this mod.
[b]Workers[/b] - displays the worker usage for buildings that have workers.
[b]Visitors[/b] - displays the visitor usage for buildings that have "visitors".
[b]Storage[/b] - displays the storage usage for buildings that store things.
[b]Vehicles[/b] - displays the vehicle usage for buildings that generate vehicles.
Each tab is described in more detail below.

[h2]Workers[/h2]
The Workers tab shows the usage of buildings that have workers.
Usage is the number of workers assigned to the building as a percent of the number of workers the building allows.
The number of workers that a zoned building allows is affected by the size, level, and density of the zoned building.
The number of workers that a service building allows is determined by the specific building and other factors.
See the list of buildings below in Building Details for Worker Types.

[h2]Visitors[/h2]
The Visitors tab shows the usage of buildings that have "visitors".
Visitors usage is the number of "visitors" at the building as a percent of the number of "visitors" the building allows.
The number of visitors that a building allows is determined by the specific building.
See the list of buildings below in Building Details for Visitor Types.

[h2]Storage[/h2]
The Storage tab shows the usage of buildings that store things.
Storage usage is the amount of a thing stored in the building as a percent of the amount of the thing the building allows.
The number of things that a building allows is determined by the specific building.
See the list of buildings below in Building Details for Storage Types.

[h2]Vehicles[/h2]
The Vehicles tab shows the usage of service buildings that generate vehicles.
Usage is the number of vehicles in use by a building as a percent of the number of vehicles the building allows.
The number of vehicles that a service building allows is affected by the specific building and the budget selections you make in the Economy view.
See the list of buildings below in Building Details for Vehicle Types.

[h2]Usage Percent[/h2]
The usage percent for each building is displayed on the building as a color gradient indicating zero to 100 percent.
The color gradients are shown on each tab for each worker, visitor, storage, and vehicle type.
Only completed buildings are shown in color.  Buildings being constructed, leveling up, abandoned, collapsed, etc. are not shown in color.
Specialized zoned buildings and ploppable buildings are shown in color.
On the Vehicles tab, the vehicles are also shown in color.  Vehicles are shown using a fixed color, not a gradient.

Each tab shows the overall usage percent for each usage type.
If there are no buildings for a type, the overall usage is grayed out.
The overall usage percent includes specialized zoned buildings and ploppable buildings.
The overall usage percent includes service buildings that have been deactivated (i.e. the building has been turned off).
A deactivated service building has workers and maintains its storage.
A deactivated service building does not have visitors and has zero vehicles in use (once all the vehicles return).

To show the number used versus the number allowed for that usage type, hover the pointer over the legend or the overall usage percent value.
The number used vs allowed does not update automatically.  To show updated numbers, move the pointer off and then over again.

[h2]Filters[/h2]
There is a check mark next to each usage type to indicate whether or not corresponding buildings are shown in color.
Clicking on the Select All or Deselect All buttons will select or deselect all the types on that tab.
Your filter selections are saved and used as the default the next time a game is played.
The overall usage percent for all types are computed and displayed regardless of whether or not the buildings are shown in color.
On the Vehicles tab, only vehicles for the selected vehicle types are shown in color.
The following Storage filters cannot be selected at the same time because they are for the same buildings:
    Unsorted Mail and Sorted Mail
    Processor Input and Processor Output (Forestry, Farming, Ore, Oil, Fishing)
    Unique Factory Input and Unique Factory Output

[h2]Detailed Usage[/h2]
Some usage types have an information symbol "i".
Click on the information symbol to show a more detailed breakdown of that usage type.
On the detail view, click on the Return button to return to the previous usage view.

[h1]Options[/h1]
To enable this mod, subscribe to it and turn it on in the Content Manager.
To disable this mod, unsubscribe from it or turn it off in the Content Manager.

This mod has no other options besides the Filters described above.

[h1]Compatibility, Limitations, and Known Issues[/h1]
This mod has been updated for and tested with all Down Loadable Content (DLC) packages thru Sunset Harbor.
This mod has been updated for and tested with all Content Creator Packs (CCP) thru Modern Japan.
Usage types for buildings specific to a DLC package or CCP will be displayed only if that DLC package or CCP is installed and active.
This mod does not require any DLC package or CCP to work properly.

This mod does not alter game save files in any way and can be disabled or unsubscribed safely at any time.

This mod does not alter the game mechanics in any way.  This mod only displays information already in the game.

This mod has been tested only on Windows.

When this mod is used with the [url=TBD]Real Time mod[/url], worker usage is still the number of workers assigned to the building, not the number of workers currently at the building.

This mod may not work correctly if another mod is enabled that alters any of the following:
   The Levels info view panel.
   The logic that gets building or vehicle color.
   The number of households, workers, visitors, storage, or vehicles a building allows.

[h1]Acknowledgments[/h1]
This mod uses the Harmony Library (version 1.2.0.1) to patch the logic that determines building and vehicle color and to patch the logic that updates the Levels info view panel.
The Harmony Library DLL file (0Harmony.dll) is downloaded automatically when you subscribe to this mod.

[h1]Revision History[/h1]
[b]Version 1.0, TBD TBD, 2020[/b] - Original.


[h1]Building Details for Worker Types[/h1]
The logic of the game grows a new zoned building when there is enough demand for a building of that zone type and there is empty zone of that type.
Because there is already demand, a newly grown zoned building will fill very quickly to near 100 percent usage.

Even though it is on the Workers tab, Residential Zone usage is the number of households in the building, not the number of workers.  A household may have more than one citizen.

However, vehicle usage percent cannot be computed because the number of vehicles allowed is unlimited.
The transportation buildings are included so that you can filter on the various buildings and see the vehicles that belong to these buildings.
Each of these buildings is tracked with the number allowed set to 1, which will cause the building to appear 100% used if any vehicles have been generated.
Transportation vehicles owned only by buildings in your city are shown in color.  Transportation vehicles owned by outside connections are not shown in color.
